    "### üíæ Saving and Loading Python Objects Persistently\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can **save** (or \"serialize\") objects to a file and **load** (or \"deserialize\") them later using the `pickle` module. This is useful for storing the state of an object between sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîÑ What is Pickle?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pickle` module allows you to convert a Python object into a byte stream and save it to a file. Later, you can load it back into your program exactly as it was.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üì¶ Saving an Object with `pickle`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pickle\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example object\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Rex\", 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save to file\n",
    "with open(\"my_dog.pkl\", \"wb\") as file:\n",
    "    pickle.dump(my_dog, file)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "- \"wb\" = write binary\n",
    "\n",
    "- pickle.dump(object, file) writes the object to the file\n",

    "#### üìÇ Loading an Object with `pickle`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pickle\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load from file\n",
    "with open(\"my_dog.pkl\", \"rb\") as file:\n",
    "    loaded_dog = pickle.load(file)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the object\n",
    "print(loaded_dog.name)\n",
    "print(loaded_dog.age)\n",
    "loaded_dog.sit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "- \"rb\" = read binary\n",
    "\n",
    "- pickle.load(file) reads the object back into memory\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ When to Use\n",
    "Use pickle when you want to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save user progress in a game\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store trained machine learning models\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes\n",
    "- üîê **Security Warning** : Never load pickled data from untrusted sources ‚Äì it can execute arbitrary code!\n",
    "\n",
    "- üóÇÔ∏è File Extension: Use .pkl or .pickle as the file extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "- üß± Objects: You can pickle most Python objects, including: Custom classes, Lists, dictionaries, Numbers, strings, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° **Challenge**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a class instance instances of some of the challenges in Week 7\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save them using pickle.dump()\n",
    "\n",
    "- Close your program\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reopen it and use pickle.load() to restore the objects\n",
    "\n",
    "- Print out the attributes of each object and call at least one of its methods\n",
